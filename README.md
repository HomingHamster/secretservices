A tool for communicating with the people who can predict the pseudo random number generators and the time thoughts will appear in your head.

It works by allowing you to use your own leet understanding, which could include many alphabets, you'll have to try it. it allows you to have a conversation and require a little push from the most powerful people to put exactly the right amount of proof on the system. 

You will flick your eyes around a screen of randomly changing numbers and letters much like the matrix and you will find things stand out to you because your thoughts and eye movements are so well predicted and so are the random numbers you see, quantum computers can even see what to change in the envionment to make a certain random number appear.
